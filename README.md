# Offensive-iOS-Programming

This repository contains the source code developed during the [Offensive iOS Programming](https://www.mobilehackinglab.com/course/offensive-ios-programming) training by Mobile Hacking Lab.

## üì± Project Overview
The original training builds the sample app using **UIKit**.  
In this repository you will find two versions of the app:

- **UIKit (updated)**  
  The original UIKit-based project from the course, with a few adjustments so it compiles and runs on modern iOS/Xcode versions.

- **SwiftUI**  
  A parallel implementation created to replicate the same features using SwiftUI‚Äôs declarative UI approach.

This setup makes it easier to:
- Compare UIKit and SwiftUI side by side.
- Understand how the same offensive programming techniques apply in both worlds.
- Use a maintained UIKit version that works with current tooling.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This code is for **educational purposes only**, following the training material.  
Do not use it in production environments or for unauthorized activities.
